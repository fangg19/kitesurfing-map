# Kitesurfing Map

This is actually a website developed for an interview on a junior front-end developer role.

The app had to allow users to log in _(works with any username/password for testing purposes)_ and view **an interactive map with pinned locations good for kitesurfing**.

The app allows the user to **add/remove** the locations from favourites and also to filter the displaying spots on the map.

Also on the second part of the front page, the user can find **a list of all the locations available that can be filtered** with more details such as the _coordinates, country, wind speed_ and also the _best period to visit_ the location and have some fun.

#### Features used, learnned and made progress on, during this project:

- React.js with Functional Components & Hooks
- React Router
- React Context API for managing some state and using it in Components
- Axios library for data fetching
- CSS Modules
